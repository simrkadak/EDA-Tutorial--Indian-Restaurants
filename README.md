What is the difference between EDA, Feature Engineering, and Preprocessing?
The main purpose is to make the raw data suitable for modeling. In EDA, we are cleaning the data and so does the preprocessing. Wheras in FE, we are scaling and imputing.

EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) as suggested by the name is an initial analysis of the data. Understanding the distributions, getting an idea of the kind of values and their range. It's getting a feel of the data before further analysis and understanding the nature of it. This would ideally give you an idea of the kind of preprocessing it would require which comes after EDA.

Preprocessing is the next step which then includes its steps to make the data fit for your models and further analysis. EDA and preprocessing might overlap in some cases.

Feature engineering is identifying and extracting features from the data, understanding the factors the decisions and predictions would be based on.
The Foremost Goals of EDA
1. Data Cleaning: EDA involves examining the information for errors, lacking values, and inconsistencies. It includes techniques including records imputation, managing missing statistics, and figuring out and getting rid of outliers.

2. Descriptive Statistics: EDA utilizes precise records to recognize the important tendency, variability, and distribution of variables. Measures like suggest, median, mode, preferred deviation, range, and percentiles are usually used.

3. Data Visualization: EDA employs visual techniques to represent the statistics graphically. Visualizations consisting of histograms, box plots, scatter plots, line plots, heatmaps, and bar charts assist in identifying styles, trends, and relationships within the facts.

4. Feature Engineering: EDA allows for the exploration of various variables and their adjustments to create new functions or derive meaningful insights. Feature engineering can contain scaling, normalization, binning, encoding express variables, and creating interplay or derived variables.

5. Correlation and Relationships: EDA allows discover relationships and dependencies between variables. Techniques such as correlation analysis, scatter plots, and pass-tabulations offer insights into the power and direction of relationships between variables.

6. Data Segmentation: EDA can contain dividing the information into significant segments based totally on sure standards or traits. This segmentation allows advantage insights into unique subgroups inside the information and might cause extra focused analysis.
7. 7. Hypothesis Generation: EDA aids in generating hypotheses or studies questions based totally on the preliminary exploration of the data. It facilitates form the inspiration for in addition evaluation and model building.

8. Data Quality Assessment: EDA permits for assessing the nice and reliability of the information. It involves checking for records integrity, consistency, and accuracy to make certain the information is suitable for analysis.
